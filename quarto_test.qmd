## Course Content {.scrollable}

- Python (Cambridge Spark focuses on the use of Python)^[Though it is not actually essenstial to use it in your projects.]
- Data privacy, ethics and regulations
- Data visualisations (mainly done in Python)
- Power BI & Tableau (optional)
- Databases & SQL^[The SQL part is really just the SQLite Python library]
- Why data science is good for businesses
- Maths for data science
- Time series analysis
- Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive analytics
    - Inferential analysis
- Introduction to machine learning
    - Predictive analysis e.g. forecasting and categorization
- Text-mining, JSON and APIs

## Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours (KSBs)

- Two separate sets: one set has to be demonstrated across your portfolio, one has to be demonstrated during your EPA project
- **Knowledge**: current legislation, data types, principles of statistics & different types of analytics
- **Skills**: apply statistical methodologies, convert data into visualisations, assess the impact of user experience
- **Behaviours**: demonstrate initiative and resilience, work independently and collaboratively

## Timeline & Commitment

- Approximately 16 months from the introductory webinar to the End Point Assessment
- Typically 3 projects that form a portfolio of work + 1 End Point Assessment project
- "Off The Job" hours: minimum 6 hours per week.
- The End Point Assessment
    - A professional discussion focusing on your portfolio
    - A presentation on your End Point Assessment project
    - Questions about your End Point Assessment project

---

## Projects that I undertook

- Automation of data processing for the Non-Bedded Community Modelling Tool
- Improving visualisations for the S136 report
- Exploration of forecasting methods applied to cancer waiting times data
- Using regression to predict improvement in Mental Health PROMs scores
- Investigating the relationship between health inequalities factors on Adult Social Care waiting times, and those waiting times on Emergency Department attendances

## Reflections

- Keep the Data Analysis Life Cycle in mind for all your projects
- Have the list of KSBs open when you are scoping and writing up your projects
- Stay focused on the STAR method when writing up your portfolio projects
